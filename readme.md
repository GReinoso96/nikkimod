# NikkiMod for GZDoom

A mod for GZDoom that:

* Adds a hub level to access different episodes.
* Makes monsters drop currency that can be spent in the hub.
* Takes away your weapons and sends you back to the hub on death.
* Allows you to buy permanent upgrades.

## Running the mod

To run the mod, you must first load 01_core, then the 02_ folder corresponding to the IWAD or mapset you want to play.

## Special options

For now, these can only be changed through the console.

* nm_dropcoins = True or False, when True, monsters will drop coins instead of them going directly to your inventory.

## Credits

* All developers and contributors of GZDoom.
* All the helpful people who have answered my questions regarding ZScript, such as Agent_Ash, Boondorl, Misery, Nash Muhandes and Jay.
* Me, Nicole "NikkiNyan", developer of this mod.
